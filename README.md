This is the submission for the exercise asked by you from me.
Apart from the requirements given by you I have made certain adjustments in the app to make it look more authentic and functional.

The Assumptions are:

1. Instead of the normal collection view cells as shown by you in the demo video, I have modified them based on a random color generating logic so that every time a new cell is produced it will be of a random colour. The colour generating logic is in the model class.

2. Morevover, I have added the functionality of adding the cells and event diversified the sections based on the user requirement so that the grid is not static anymore.

3. I have also added a Introduction view which is based on a third party library. You can skip to the main screen.

4. I have also used some other 3rd party open source libraries like ILBarButton for setting the images of the bar button.

5. A category is used to shift the bar buttons to its normal position as its shifts relatively in iOS 7.
